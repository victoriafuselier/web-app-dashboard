Treehouse Project 7: WebApp Dashboard

The goal of this project was to use a mockup and a few icons to build a beautiful web dashboard complete with JavaScript-driven charts and graphs. The project starter files consisted of 3 mockup images for 3 screen widths, 8 SVG icons, and 4 sample member images. I was required to write the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for this page.

The basic requirements of this project included: creating a responsive web page from the supplied mockup, ensuring that the design responds well to mobile (320px), tablet (768px), and desktop (1024px) screen widths; creating SVG icon based navigation; creating a demo alert notification triggered by the notification bell icon in navigation header, adding CSS transition or animation on the bell icon; using supplied chart.js file to create the 3 chart widgets (line chart, bar chart, and donut chart) as shown in the mockup; creating a social stats widget with provided SVG icons for each of the social networks; creating new members and recent activity widgets as shown in the mockup, including avatars with each member; creating a message user widget with a search field to find the member that the user searches for, including a submit button that simulates the send action by notifying the user that the messgae was sent; creating a settings widget with on/off switch for two settings--email notifications and public profile, a dropdown menu to select timesone, save and cancel buttons.

The extra credit requirements of this project included: displaying at least two notifications at the same time when user clicks the alerts icon; creating a navigation similar to the one in the mockup to add to the traffic chart widget so that different data displays when the traffic nav buttons are clicked; adding an autocomplete feature to the 'search for user' box, listing names that match the search term; using local storage to save the settings.

I went beyond the requirements listed above by: using a mobile-first approach to ensure the web app functions and displays well on all previously required breakpoints of 320px, 768px, 1024px and wider; adding more than 2 notifications to notification pop up window; adding a 'dismiss' button to each of the notifications displayed.
